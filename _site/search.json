    "section": "",
    "text": "Image credit: Chetan Chawla\nI have been a heavy consumer of blogs (mainly business and technology) for over a decade and recently began to think that I should turn my attention to producing. When I decided to write this blog, a few things about blogging (medium of expression both liberates and lassos you) stood out:\n\nBlogs are inherently conversational and express “the unedited voice of a single person”.\nHowever, this conversational and topical nature (the very things that attract an audience) of blogs (true to a lesser extent of other mediums like talk radio, TV etc.) make them highly susceptible to heuristic biases and logical fallacies.\nBiases and ease of publication (no editorial or peer review required) on part of the author combined with tendency towards confirmation biases on part of the reader means that many blogs spiral downwards into echo chambers.\n\nAs a general warning/ checklist for both my writing and readers, I have a list of (some) common biases below that have the potential to affect my writing. Since this list is based on the most common biases (full list of biases) I have noticed as a reader, they apply equally to any other blog posts you may be reading.\nThe Bias Checklist:\n\nAvailability bias : refers to what comes first to mind or is easily recalled. In making this list, I am guilty of the availability bias.\nConfirmation bias: tendency to look for evidence that confirms existing beliefs/ theories. Alternative is actively seeking falsification. I have yet to come across a blog that actively seeks falsification, reader comments can provide counter-examples but often degenerate into trolling.\nBase rate fallacy : far more common than realized, base rate is the frequency of a generic type of event. This is significantly driven by the fact that blogs are topical and hence writers are exposed to specific rather than representative samples from any given population. The best way to avoid this fallacy is to always keep in mind (or look for) the base rate (of event under consideration) for the whole population.\nSelf-serving bias : refers to tendency of individuals to attribute their success to themselves and failure to external factors. This shows up heavily in business and technology contexts as halo and network effects are systematically underestimated as drivers of success. For example, is a company successful because of the attributes (schooling etc.) of a CEO/ company (behind headlines such as: “How to Innovate like…” or “10 Takeaways from ….”) or because the starting conditions led to dominant positions?\nSurvivorship bias : this is perhaps the most common misleading bias both because of the popularity of success and hustle culture, but also because of the bigger problem of follow you passion being infused throughout the West. It refers to tendency to focus on companies (or individuals) that survived a process rather than the starting population. I claim this to be the most misleading because it give a false sense of understanding and causality. Just because some attribute (innovation, html5 ninjas, hoodies, short meetings) is present in successful companies doesn’t imply that it is causally linked to their success. An easy way to spot this one is to see the sample being used, did the writer/ blogger/ researcher talk to or survey the starting population or just those that succeeded? This bias is rampant in studies of entrepreneurship, technology and innovation. Discount the claims of any blog post/ research that is based ONLY on successful companies or entrepreneurs. The danger of such research has been highlighted by writers like Nassim N.Taleb and the medical researcher John P.A. Ioannidis.\n\nI tend to keep this checklist in mind when reading and (hopefully) will be able to avoid falling into these traps while writing. Whenever it is not possible for me to avoid a bias (for example, when writing about social networks I will likely be indulging in survivorship bias by focusing on the top few companies in the industry) I will point out that shortcoming as a limitation of any inferences I make. As always, caveat lector – reader beware!"

    "title": "Deep Work – Book Review",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Image credit: Chetan Chawla\nWhat?: Book Review of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World.\nGoal: Deep work (page 3 of book) = “Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push you cognitive capabilities to the limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”\nKryptonite: Shallow work (page 7 of book) = “Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.”\nWhy?: Must read book for knowledge workers seeking to reduce the distractions in their lives and reclaim the ability to do deep work. These notes are my own attempt at doing deep work on developing the process of deep work.\nHow?: My notes are below, hopefully will give sense of the structure/logic of the books arguments (in Part 1: The Idea) and process (in Part 2: The Rules). The book is highly recommended, link to purchase is above.\nINTRODUCTION\nCal opens with the story of Carl Jung’ deep work sanctuary in the town of Bollingen. Taken from Mason Curry’ fantastic book Daily Rituals: How Artists Work.\nThe Daily Rituals book is a good companion piece to Deep Work and I highly recommend both since it demonstrates the actual thoughtfulness that went into the productive daily rituals of dozens of artists and creators. One can argue that “talent” and “genius” are an excuse that many of us use to let ourselves off the hook for not doing deep work. Swimming in the shallows is much easier.\nCarl Jung needed his Bollingen sanctuary to do the consistent deep work necessary to counter the Freudian school in the 1920s and build the field of analytical psychology. Cal makes the argument that figures as diverse as J.K. Rowling and Bill Gates accomplished what they did due to a deep commitment to deep work – a rare and increasingly difficult skill in our hyperconnected/ distracted world.\nCal argues that unlike the folks mentioned above and many others, modern knowledge workers are losing the ability to do deep work – because of network tools (combination of social networking and infotainment sites optimized to keep you in the shallows: Facebook, Twitter, email, sms, Reddit, Buzzfeed etc.) that replace such deep work with connectivity and resultant shallow work. Network tools are ultimately responsible for fragmenting our discipline, days and schedules such that the unbroken chunks of time needed for deep work are not available.\nFor someone like me who has been working on developing deep work ability for sometime, these arguments are non-controversial. I believe whole sectors of the economy (e.g. advertising) are built around attention theft and distraction. The Internet just makes this worse since it enables jumping from one shallow to another painless and addictive.\nHowever, this is not all bad. The very fact that you have read this review (hopefully without jumping to quickly check your Facebook, Twitter, email or text message feed) this far increases the odds that you agree with Cal’ core idea behind Deep Work (from page 8 of book):\n“Our work culture’ shift towards the shallow (whether you think it is philosophically good or bad) is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth…”\nAnecdote about Jason Benn’ learning programming…to highlight the contemporary benefit of deep work:\n\nDeep work allows you to learn fast – an incredibly valuable skill at a time that our information economy is dependent on fast evolving and complex systems.\nDeep work allows you to capitalize on the digital network revolution instead of getting drowned in its distracting shallows. By actually focusing on producing (instead of just consuming the latest distraction…) your best quality work, you can reach much larger audiences. A simple heuristic would be to not get stuck in the shallows of easy skills (from page 14 of book):\n\n“The real rewards are reserved not for those who are comfortable using Facebook (a shallow task, easily replicated), but instead for those who are comfortable building the innovative distributed systems that run the service (a decidedly deep task, hard to replicate)…”\nThe Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.\nFor those still not convinced, Part 1 argues more deeply about the importance of deep work.\nPART 1: THE IDEA\nFor those on the fence, important to realize that deep work is increasingly THE differentiating factor for successful knowledge workers. In a world where most of your competitors are drowning in the shallows (social media, multi-tasking etc.), building your ability to do deep work is valuable, rare and meaningful – i.e., critical for a successful/ consequential life.\nChapter 1: Deep Work is Valuable\nStories about the value created by the deep work of Nate Silver, David H. Hansson and John Doerr. These three respectively belong to three separate categories of 21st century workers outlined in the book Race Against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy\n\nThe High-skilled workers: comfort with complex systems and intelligent machines.\nThe Superstars: With no/few substitutes in “winner-takes-all” markets.\nThe Owners: the capital providers who can leverage technology on a never before seen scale.\n\nCal argues that if you can join one of these three groups, you will do well. If you can’t, you might still do well (due to local factors like supply-demand in your region and/or industry) but your situation will be more precarious.\nTwo Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:\n\nThe ability to quickly master hard things: The learning payoff from deep work. Anecdotes about Nate Silver, SQL databases and Stata (I was surprised to learn that Nate Silver doesn’t use R). Simply put, your ability to comprehend complex systems and learn the tools that make these systems understandable and actionable requires deep work and deliberate practice.\nThe ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed: Story of David Hansson’ reaching programming superstardom by creating Ruby on Rails. The work process of marketing professor Adam Grant was in a recent book excerpt.\n\nCal ends this chapter with a brief on Jack Dorsey (co-founder of Twitter & Square) as a person who thrives without depth. However, this was in my opinion one of the weaker sections of the book since Dorsey is now clearly more of a manager than a maker, a distinction wonderfully made by Paul Graham.\nChapter 2: Deep Work is Rare\nThree trends in the workplace that damage your ability to do deep dives: 1. Open-offices: a complete shift towards collaborative work spaces at new tech companies such as Facebook. Microsoft in its heyday used to publicize getting your own office as key to doing valuable work 2. Instant messaging 3. Push for content producers to maintain social media presence\nAll three trends decrease one’s ability to do deep work due to attention fragmentation. Cal argues that the unquestioned support for these trends is a result of the difficulty of assigning credit to individuals for contributions (what economists call performance ambiguity). In the absence of clear metrics for deeper work, busyness becomes a proxy for productivity.\nThe Principle of Least Resistance (page 58 onwards): In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment…[this principle} “protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value.”\nBusyness as Proxy for Productivity (page 64): In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.\nI especially liked this section since it gets to the core of why people waste time in impression management by doing busywork – the black hole of performance metrics makes the quick responder to emails/ messages appear to be a great producer in spite of their drowning in the shallows doing easily replicable work.\nChapter 3: Deep Work is Meaningful\nEasily the most philosophical section of the book – Cal connects deep work with the sacred craftsmanship embodied in the work of Mathew Crawford Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry into the Value of Work.\nThe link between depth and meaningful work gets muddied as knowledge workers are encouraged to engage the “community” via social networking, i.e., stay in the shallows. Similar to the earlier connection between deliberate practice and deep work, in this section Cal connects depth to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’ notion of Flow and its link with happiness, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (Harper Perennial Modern Classics).\nThis section ends with what was the theme of Cal’s earlier book: So Good They Can’t Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love:\nDeep Work/Flow/ Deliberate Practice ⇒ Career Capital ⇒ Opportunities and Success.\nNotice that “follow your passion” is not part of this equation. Instead, the key insight (page 91) is that:\n“You don’t need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work.”\nIf one is undisciplined and unfocused enough to be distracted by shallow work, the solution is not a “dream job” but developing a more craftsperson like approach to ones work and putting in the rituals and processes that allow deep work to happen, the point of the next section of the book.\nPART 2: THE RULES\nThis is arguably the more important part of the book since it focuses on actual steps to take as you build your Deep Work processes. This part is split into four rules (chapters):\nRule #1: Work Deeply\nUnderstand the importance of willpower as a finite resource (I no longer believe that willpower is a finite resource. People conflate ego depletion or finite willpower with decision fatigue. In addition, the idea of ego depletion or finite willpower has not been supported in replication studies) i.e., structure your life to limit its depletion. Routines and rituals protect you from letting your attention get hijacked by the superficial.\nHere Cal introduces 4 philosophies of Deep Work:\n\nThe Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work: could be title the way of the reclusive genius, exemplified by Stanford’ Donald Knuth and Neal Stephenson This strategy works by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.\n\nKey question: would you like to be known for creating iconoclastic works or for being responsive and approachable? Clearly, not a strategy for everyone.\n\nThe Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work: A more reasonable work strategy, involves splitting your days between deep and shallow work. The former periods should allow for unbroken cognitive intensity, i.e., no open emails or Facebook newsfeeds. A very attractive idea from Cal (page 108): “dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time.”\n\nKey question: is the value derived (serendipity, collaboration etc.) or need for (part of job etc.) shallow work great enough that the monastic style wouldn’t work.\n\nThe Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work: Transform deep work into regularly scheduled work and don’t break the chain.\n\nKey question: Is your day-to-day life going to allow you to follow a bimodal (let alone monastic) process? If not, the rhythmic philosophy might be for you. It allows for daily scheduling and chipping away at building your deep work muscles instead of running the equivalent of a deep work marathon as a beginner.\n\nThe Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work (115): In this section Cal uses Walter Issacson’ career as a prototype. Apparently, Issacson due to his training as a journalist (constant deadline driven writing habit) was trained to “shift into a writing mode on a moments notice.”\n\nKey question: This philosophy depends heavily on your ability to do the instantaneous cognitive switches from shallow to deep work when time permits. Can you do that?\nAccording to Cal, he follows the journalistic method although he organizes/schedules deep work.\nRitualizing and scheduling key elements (Where you’ll work? How long? How you’ll work? How you’ll support your work) will reduce your cognitive switching costs, decision fatigue and willpower depletion that can derail the best-laid plans.\nThe remainder of this chapter discusses the grand gesture (demonstrating commitment either in time and/or $ in doing the deep work), the hub-and-spoke architecture of innovation (switching between collaborative serendipity and isolated deep work), the whiteboard effect (collaboration as a way to add deadlines/ constraints to trigger deep work).\nThe Four Disciplines of Executing (since executing is more difficult than strategizing): 1. Focus on the wildly important: i.e. make the priority THE PRIORITY. 2. Act on lead measure: e.g. focus on inputs (hours spent/week in deep work) than distant outputs. 3. Keep a compelling scorecard: to tally and calibrate #2. 4. Create a cadence of accountability: use scheduled reviews to link your plans to execution.\nBe Lazy: (page 143) “deep work – the serious efforts that produce things the world values…these efforts need the support of a mind regularly released to leisure.” Shutdown work thinking completely at the end of the day – avoid the pinprick onslaught of small obligations. Formalizing this process by actually having a shutdown ritual was my key takeaway from the end of this section.\nRule #2: Embrace Boredom\nAbility to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained…simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.\nMost people take breaks from distractions (email, instant messaging, meetings, social networking etc.) to work. Cal recommends the opposite (161): “schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction”. Here’s a challenge: schedule in advance when you will use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times.\nThree points about Internet Scheduling:\n\nThis strategy works even if your job requires internet use and/or prompt email replies: you can schedule internet blocks frequently.\nKeep the time outside internet blocks absolutely internet-free: self-explanatory, resist the temptation to give in.\nSchedule the internet at home as well to improve concentration training: ignore texts, calls, internet outside of your scheduled blocks – even at home.\n\n“to wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it’s incredibly valuable.” (page 165)\nProductive Meditation (170): take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally – walking, jogging, driving, showering, swimming (in my case) – to focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem (writing a paper outline, preparing a talk, business strategy etc.).\nSuggestion #1: Be wary of distraction & looping – i.e. avoiding going deeper/ next steps and instead attention just rehashing what you already know.\nSuggestion #2: Structure your deep thinking – i.e. keep the relevant variables in your working memory to play around with. Define the next-step questions.\nRule #3: Quit Social Media\nThis will be hard for many. Having quit Facebook 6 months ago for good, I understand Cal’s point about people looking at social network avoidance as an eccentricity.\nSocial networks fragment our time and attention – I now think of them almost as junk food, cant be part of a healthy lifestyle (although Twitter addiction is still an issue for me – working on it).\nCal’s fundamental argument (page 184): “accepting that these tools are not inherently evil, they might even be useful…but at the same time also accepting that the threshold for allowing a site regular access to your time and attention (not to mention personal data) should be much more stringent.”\nThe problem is that most people fall for FOMO and use…\nThe Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.\nInstead use a more thoughtful approach to curating the tools that consume your time and attention…\nThe Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: (page 191) Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impact on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impact.\nThe key takeaway here is to actually thoughtfully identify your goals (both professional and personal) and then analyze the impact of network (substantially +, substantially – or 0) tools on them. The word substantially is key, if excluded you run the risk of invoking FOMO for every tool out there.\nCal outlines examples of both professional (page 196) and personal goals (page 198) that are really succinct and allow you have a laser focus on priorities and the key activities that support.\nThe personal goal (maintaining close and rewarding friendships with a group of people who are important to me) is reflected in the key activities (which are not supported by Facebook).\n\nRegularly take the time for meaningful connections with those who are most important to me (e.g. a long talk, a meal, joint activity).\nGive of myself to those who are most important to me (e.g. making nontrivial sacrifices that improve their lives)\n\n“If you service low-impact activities, therefore, you’re taking away time you could be spending on high-impact activities.”\nLeave social media (all) for 30 days, then ask yourself: 1. Would the last 30 days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? 2. Did people care that I wasn’t using this service?\nThe second question gets to the common belief that “people care what I have to say” According to Cal the rise of social media is driven by the disconnect between the real hard work of producing real value and the positive reward of having people pay attention to you. (page 207)\nInstead, what we have a low-value quid pro quo of you “like” my status update and I’ll “like” yours.\nA corollary of the above insight (applies to both social media and infotainment) is the need to put more thought into your leisure time – not getting lost in fruitless rabbit holes of clickbait.\nRule #4: Drain the Shallows\nThe last chapter focuses on the reality that many people will identify with – most workdays are not filled with real deep work but instead swimming in the shallows. Using the example of 37signal’ cofounder Jason Fried’s experiments with reduced work days following the logic that “When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely”…Cal recommends:\nRuthlessly identify the shallowness in your current schedule…treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is vastly underestimated (page 221).\nSchedule your days in 30-minute increments – DO NOT LIVE IN AUTOPILOT MODE\nMuch of this section is derived from Cal’ fantastic blog that I recommend you check out:\nScheduling isn’t about constraints – its about thoughtfulness.\n“You must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.” (page 227).\nA great takeaway from this part is this simple question to quantify the depth of any task: How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?\nSay NO to projects infused with shallowness…make NO the default answer.\nBecome Hard to Reach\n\nMake people who send you email do more work – create sender filters.\nDo more work when you send or reply to emails – i.e. close loops…\nDon’t respond: avoid responses to emails that have one or more of the following:\n\n\n\nAmbiguous or hard to make reasonable response.\nNot a question or proposal that interests you.\nNothing good would happen if you did respond and nothing bad would happen if you didn’t respond.\n\nThis connects with Tim Ferriss’ blog post on Letting Bad Things Happen.\nCONCLUSION\nI cannot recommend this book highly enough. As I mentioned in the opening, this review is really for my own use – to keep myself accountable to doing deep work. But I have no doubt that if you found my notes interesting enough to reach till this point, the book will be transformative.\nDeep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World"

    "text": "Image credit: Chetan Chawla\nIt’s great to see so many people reacting strongly to Jill Lepore’ critique of disruptive innovation in the New Yorker. In spite of the ad hominen fallacy that both Lepore and her critics indulge in, reality is that disruptive innovation has received strong criticism within management academia. My Ph.D. comprehensive exams in 2012 were on disruptive innovation so I am a little familiar with the scholarly literature on disruption. A few points to note:\n\nDisruptive innovation has repeatedly received high quality criticism from serious scholars, some examples are:\n\nDanneels, E. 2004. Disruptive technology reconsidered: A critique and research agenda. Journal of Product Innovation Management, 21(4): 246-258.\nGovindarajan, V. & Kopalle, P. K. 2006. The Usefulness of Measuring Disruptiveness of Innovations Ex Post in Making Ex Ante Predictions. Journal of Product Innovation Management, 23(1): 12-18.\nMarkides, C. 2006. Disruptive Innovation: In Need of Better Theory. Journal of Product Innovation Management, 23(1): 19-25.\nSchmidt, G. M. & Druehl, C. T. 2008. When Is a Disruptive Innovation Disruptive? Journal of Product Innovation Management, 25(4): 347-369.\nYu, D. & Hang, C. C. 2010. A reflective review of Disruptive Innovation Theory. International Journal of Management Reviews.\n\nClayton Christensen has himself acknowledged the significant amount of work that has gone into (& still needs to be done) the evolving theory of disruption:\n\nChristensen, C. M. 2006. The ongoing process of building a theory of disruption. Journal of Product Innovation Management, 23(1): 39-55.\n\nThe most common critique of disruption – that Prof. Christensen completely misread the emergence of the Apple iPhone ecosystem is true. But that was driven by the original theory of disruption being focused on low-cost disruption, i.e. new technology or business models enabling small/new firms to beat incumbent/large firms by taking away their over-served customers*. Subsequent criticism of this low-cost focus (see e.g. Danneels 2004) and development of high-end disruption concept (see Govindarajan & Kopalle 2006) actually show the evolution of the theory. The key problem with disruption seems to be that many of its skeptics and critics are not aware of the vast literature (48 peer-reviewed articles at the time of my comps in 2012, probably higher now) and have obviously not kept up with newer developments in the theory.\n\nI’ll revisit disruptive innovation in much more detail in a future blog post, especially to address some key issues/ misconceptions around it, such as:\n\nDisruption does not imply fatalism: it is not a given that a startup will unseat the incumbent from its throne…provided the larger firms keep catering to shifting customer demands.\nDisruption has similarities with real options theory: this is a tricky one since it implies asymmetric payoffs – which makes people skeptical since “on average” most new technologies/startups fail, however the ones that do succeed more than cover for the losses (ask any successful VC/ startup investor). Theoreticians used to evaluating “the average” firm underestimate the power of power law distributions.\nDisruption also has similarities with the lean startup movement: the lean startup methodology helps new firms find new sources of customer value (through hypotheses tests) that may not be obvious to larger, more established companies.\n\nNonetheless, the disruption framework remains useful in navigating the foggy waters of future product development.\n*Ben Thompson over at Stratechery has outlined how this focus on low-cost disruption and serving “overcharged” customers breaks down in consumer markets ."

They have a cognitive need for closure that is satisfied by bludgeoning reality into their favorite model/worldview.\nTetlock, in his book, goes on to empirically demonstrate how foxes have been better forecasters than hedgehogs in the arena of political science. Not surprisingly this distinction between foxes and hedgehogs makes intuitive sense and similar forecasting results (i.e., foxes perform better) are likely in fields which are high in complexity and uncertainty. The dynamic nature of such fields (including business, economics, technology etc.) makes “experts” with one big idea vulnerable to getting blindsided by unexpected big events, i.e. The Black Swan.\nA recent post by Nassim Taleb highlighted the way people’s identities are wrapped up in their work and accomplishments. Nassim argues that this is not only different from the past (ancients) but also varies across the economic spectrum with only the minimum wage earners being able to separate their identities from the mode of earning a living. This undoubtedly ties into his earlier point about never taking advice from people wearing a tie. Those whose identities are close to their (knowledge) work tend to overlook the fallibility in their fields. A mind focused on falsification and professional pride are rarely seen in the same person*. So how can one (especially if you are a ‘knowledge worker’) avoid this problem? I think Paul Graham had the best advice (closely tied to but broader than Nassim’s comment) : “The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.” Keep your identity small.\n*PS: In the almost decade since this post was written, its clear that the widespread replication crisis in the social sciences, medicine etc. has only given more weight to this argument."

    "title": "Startups & Growth - Cui bono?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Image credit: Chetan Chawla\nA recent blog post by Paul Graham got me thinking about how growth in recent years has being positioned as THE goal of all early stage firms (i.e., startups). All good things flow from the achievement of this ephemeral target, in fact those who can help early stage firms get this growth have been labeled growth hackers. One of the fascinating things about this focus on growth above all else is that it was not always so. The purpose of this post is to briefly give an overview of two distinct priorities in the pursuit of success (growth vs. profit) that have been common not just in the tech sector but also in more traditional industries (public company valuations have for a long time been split into these two categories). Ostensibly in the technology sector growth either accompanies or is shortly followed by profitability.\nIn order to build on these two distinctions and link them to this “growth fallacy” i’ll divide the business landscape into the two categories conceived by Nassim Taleb, namely mediocristan and extremistan , he developed this distinction in his book The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable with a new section, “On Robustness and Fragility”.\nIn order to show how entrepreneurs can better analyze these landscapes i’ll use some simple concepts from strategic management (value creation vs. capture and disruptive innovation) to explain why this pursuit of growth is great from the point of view of angel investors and venture capitalists but not necessarily for entrepreneurs (critical distinction that is glossed over in most posts on startup growth).\nGrowth Hacking - Cui bono?\nThe gist of Paul Graham’s growth post is that startups are citizens of Extremistan while most conventional businesses are in Mediocristan, i.e. startups are exclusively high growth ventures that are not constrained by distribution and other barriers that limit the growth of most conventional businesses. However, the lack of these barriers also means that you have global competition and a crowded landscape which makes the entrepreneurial idiosyncrasies more valuable.\nThese idiosyncrasies are valuable because they not only allow entrepreneurs to spot new openings in the landscape but also utilize new technologies to target these opportunities. High growth (either revenues or users in case of Y Combinator) startups will presumably after n iterations hit upon some form of success, Paul emphasizes this frequent iteration and targeting of growth in his post:\n“Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is just a form of procrastination. Whereas founders’ intuitions about which hill to climb are usually better than they realize. Plus the maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated. Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.”\nObviously, if the primary objective of a startup is growth then targeting Extremistan landscapes makes sense. These tend to be highly scalable businesses that are (frequently) populated by competitors since barriers to entry are lower (e.g. mobile applications). However, barriers to success (= growth?) are higher simply because these fields tend to be cluttered and its harder to genuinely differentiate oneself and create customer value. Its even harder to actually capture that value because close substitutes are usually available at low cost. From the perspective of the entrepreneur, the base rate of success is pathetic.\nWhich raises the question: who benefits from this unbridled pursuit of growth? Here again, Nassim Taleb’s insights (more often used than acknowledged) are valuable. One of the key features of Extremistan is that it is the domain of Black Swans (unexpected events with high impact that give illusion of predictability after the fact). These Black Swans can have negative impact (financial crisis of 2008 for those who didn’t see it coming) as well as positive (investing in the next big thing). Taleb’s consistent advice (in Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan and his forthcoming book on Antifragility) has been to position oneself on the winning side of Black Swans, both by minimizing exposure to risky non-linearities and increasing exposure to their upside. The latter include venture capital/ angel investing opportunities that (for limited $ investment) have a call option on a potential bigger upside. And therein lies the rub, the answer to the question I asked earlier is that blind pursuit of growth benefits the buyers (VC or Angel investors) of these call options and not the individual options (i.e., the entrepreneur) themselves, because for the entrepreneur the average outcome of his angel investor’s portfolio is meaningless (you can drown in a river that is 4 ft. deep on average) but for the angel, that is a key metric. Thus, what works for early investors may not be optimal for entrepreneurs wanting to create real businesses.\nNow I turn my attention to the basic goal of all business strategies.\nCompetitive Advantage\nIf you are an entrepreneur, your goal ought to be profitable growth that accrues from competitive advantage, some have already pointed out the complex issues surrounding pursuit of growth in tech investing. But calls for pursuing revenue and/or user growth with no talk of profits merely risks repeating the errors of the last tech bubble. With few outliers (who get media coverage without any mention of base rates of success) getting all the attention, its easy to forget how much the system goes against common sense approaches to building real businesses.\nThe simplest and most relevant framework in this context is Clayton Christensen’s disruptive innovation. An additional benefit of using this lens to look at the growth question is that disruption is commonly invoked (often un-justified) in the internet and tech investing sector. Since his theories are so well known, I won’t rehash them here. For entrepreneurs, a good starting point is his book Seeing What’s Next: Using Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change.\nOne overlooked element of the disruption framework of Clayton Christensen is his emphasis on profits (not revenue or user growth). There are a couple of reasons why this distinction is so critical for entrepreneurs:\n\nPursuit of profits forces entrepreneurs to vet ideas on a critical dimension: are customers actually willing to pay for it? Early pursuit of profitability thus becomes important as a validation exercise.\nProfits imply that the cost structure is low enough for the startup to actually manage to capture value in addition to merely creating it (which metrics like user or revenue growth indicate). Value capture cannot happen unless genuine moats are present around the business. Hence, high traction in users or revenues may imply that you have reached a local maxima that is valuable but indefensible. Great for exits that may not be such good ideas for the acquirer. This factor is another reason why raising lots of venture capital in early rounds can distort the value of the opportunity since external capital can makeup for weaknesses in profitability. Groupon is a classic example of why growth (revenue or user) at the expense of profitability and competitive advantage may not be sustainable.\n\nWhich brings us back to the key difference between being a buyer/holder of multiple call options (VC/ Angel) vs. being an actual entrepreneur. If you are in the former category, pursuing multiple opportunities in Extremistan and pushing them for high growth makes sense since you only need one or two outliers to make your performance exceptional. However, if you are the entrepreneur, it is highly risky to pursue un-profitable growth (every time someone gives you the example of unprofitable startups that made 8 or 9 figure exits like Instagram, take a few deep breaths and silently repeat..anecdote…anecdote…anecdote). Ask yourself cui bono?"

In sum, I compare perspectives on trust in these traditional theories to the conception of trust in blockchains – a mix of algorithmic, and organizational – to offer new insights into the implications of the rise of blockchains."
